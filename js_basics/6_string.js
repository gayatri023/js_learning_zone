console.log(gameName.charAt(3)); // give empty object

const anotherString = gameName.slice(-8,4)   //accept negataive value and works like this 
// - negative indices are interpreted as offsets from the end of the string. 
/* If the slice is defined as .slice(-9, 4) and the string is 'hiteshhc' (length = 8), 
here's how it will behave:
resolvedIndex = stringLength + negativeIndex
resolvedIndex = 8 + (-9) = -1

A resolved index of -1 is out of bounds because it refers to a position before the start of the string.
When a starting index (start) is out of bounds (less than 0), JavaScript considers it as 0, the beginning 
of the string.
Therefore, slice(-9, 4) behaves the same as slice(0, 4).
